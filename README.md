I created this project as a Maven-based Java application to streamline the process of building, testing, and packaging a standalone program. The main goal is to develop a self-contained executable JAR that includes all necessary dependencies, making it easy to run on any system.

The project’s main entry point is a HelloWorld class, which serves as the starting point when the application is executed. I’ve set it up with Maven to automate key tasks like compilation, dependency management, and packaging. This means that as the project grows, I won’t need to manually handle dependencies; Maven takes care of it for me.

For testing, I’ve integrated JUnit, a unit testing framework, ensuring the code is robust and reliable by running tests before the final package is built. To maintain code quality, I’ve connected the project to SonarQube, a static code analysis tool, which helps identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement in the code.

Even though I haven’t fully activated it yet, I’ve included placeholders for version control and issue tracking using Git and GitHub. This will allow easy collaboration, version history tracking, and issue management in the future.

In summary, this project is designed as a template for building small, standalone Java applications that are easy to manage, test, and deploy. It’s set up with the future in mind, ensuring that it can scale, while maintaining clean, high-quality code.
